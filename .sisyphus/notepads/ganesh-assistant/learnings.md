# Ganesh Assistant Learnings

## Conventions
- Use Conventional Commits: `feat(scope): description`
- Python backend: FastAPI, pytest, mypy, ruff
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + vitest
- Desktop: Tauri v2
- All ports must be ephemeral (never hardcoded)
- Dark theme only (no light mode)
- Windows + Linux only (no macOS)

## Patterns
- TDD: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
- Each commit leaves repo buildable + testable
- Sidecar spec changes are separate commits from feature code

## Decisions
- Stack: Python (backend) + React/TS (frontend) + Tauri v2 (shell)
- Memory: mem0 OSS + LanceDB
- Voice: faster-whisper + Piper
- LLM: LiteLLM routing (OpenAI default)
- License: PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0
## Wave 0: Foundation
- Scaffolded project structure with backend (FastAPI), frontend (Vite/React/TS), and src-tauri (Tauri v2).
- Configured pyproject.toml with required dependencies.
- Configured package.json with Vitest and Tailwind CSS.
- Initialized git repository with appropriate .gitignore.
- Created README.md and LICENSE (PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0).
- Verified directory structure manually.
## Wave 0: Scaffold Fixes
- Replaced LICENSE placeholder with full PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0 text.
- Fixed frontend React scaffold:
    - Replaced main.ts with main.tsx.
    - Created App.tsx with minimal 'Ganesh' heading.
    - Updated index.html and index.css.
    - Created vite.config.ts with @vitejs/plugin-react.
    - Removed vanilla Vite template assets and files.
- Updated Tauri configuration:
    - Restricted bundle targets to Windows and Linux (deb, appimage, msi, nsis).
    - Removed .icns icon.
    - Set CSP to allow connect-src http://127.0.0.1:*.
- Updated and verified project structure tests:
    - Backend tests verify critical directories and files.
    - Frontend tests verify key React and Vite files.
- Note: cargo check could not be verified due to missing cargo/rustc in the environment.
